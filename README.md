# time-series-analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with a tutorial for generating a synthetic time series and commands for first-order statistical analysis.

At the end of the code it is possible to generate a CSV file that contains the artificially created time series.

This notebook is useful for undergraduate students taking their first steps in the field of signal processing and for educators who need to prepare lessons and assignments.
